This is an OptimFROG plugin for the Audacious media player.

To build, the OptimFROG SDK (http://www.losslessaudio.org/SDK.php) is
required.  Only version 1.400 (corresponding to OptimFROG 5.000) and
later are supported.  In addition, for vendors who create separate
development versions of packages, the development version of audacious
is required; this will likely be called something like audacious-dev or
audacious-devel.

GNU make is required, as is a compiler that supports C++11.  Recent
versions of GCC and Clang are both supported.  Other C++11 compilers
should work, too, but may require the tweaking of compiler.mk.

Once dependencies are installed, build as follows:

$ make OPTIMFROG=/path/to/OptimFROG_Linux_x64_5002/SDK

For the time being you must explicitly pass the location of the
OptimFROG SDK.  Moreover, the shared library (libOptimFROG.so) must be
available to the dynamic linker.  The build process sets the RPATH to
the build-time location of the library, but a more permanent location
(such as /usr/lib) would be less fragile.

To install:

$ make install

This installs the plugin into Audacious's input plugin directory.  To
install to a staging area, such as for packaging:

$ make install DESTDIR=/path/to/staging
